### Research Interests
Interested in using knowledge for natural language processing. Studied on converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries to access knowledge and building a dialogue system over context and knowledge using a neural network model with external memories. Addressing multi-hop question answering with the tensor product of knowledge.
